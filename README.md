# Bandit-Algorithms

This is a repository for educational materials to help learn about 
multi-arm bandits, or bandit algorithms. 

This repo builds off 
of the wonderful book [Bandit Algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf),
graciously published for free online 
by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesv√°ri.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me,
