# Bandit-Algorithms

This is a repository for educational materials to help learn about 
multi-arm bandits, or bandit algorithms. 

This "course" (for lack of a better term) builds off 
of the wonderful book [Bandit Algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf),
graciously published for free online 
by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesv√°ri (big props, much love <3).

As much as possible, I will be attempting to create Jupyter Notebooks 
that try to get at the core of what is presented in the major chapters. 
Furthermore, when it comes to algorithms presented, 
I will be trying to provide a framework/testbed for any interested people
to get their hands on some of these algorithms and try them out!

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me,
